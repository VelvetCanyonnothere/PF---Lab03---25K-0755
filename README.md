My name is Muhammad Shaheer Khan. I have done my O-levels from BVS and A - levels from Cedar College. I have been doing programming since 2021 from pseudocode to flowcharts and then python and now I am doing coding in C. I like to code as it enables me to solve problems and help me in my critical thinking.
